* Create releases of Emacs packages

Create a release and watch it roll down the hill again.

This package is fairly opinionated, but not all of those opinions
are mine.

That is, I don't think it is a good idea to put version strings in
Elisp libraries, but because some of my packages are distributed on
[Non]GNU Elpa, I have to do that anyway.  Please see the docstring
of ~sisyphus-non-release-bump-header~ for more information.

*Typical workflow*

- Update release notes.
- Create a release commit using ~t c~ (~sisyphus-create-release~).
- Create a release tag using ~t r~ (~magit-tag-release~).
- Create post release commit using ~t g~ (~sisyphus-bump-post-release~).

*Recommended setup*

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'magit (require 'sisyphus))
#+end_src
